You can use two approaches

1. You can use fucntions and rects
2. Or you can use classes, sprites and methods
(Approach 2 is better)


Bullet Logic

1. Get position of player (or whatever shoots the bullet)
2. Create a bullet in that place (I will use a Rect)
3. Move the bullet in a direction (right in this game)

Specific code login

Player Sprite
- follows mouse
- creates bullet

Bullet Sprite
- moves right
- destroys itself when it gets too far too the right.

Bullets without sprites are possible but try to avoid it.
Example -

def Shoot(bullets):
    global bullet_ready

    # Create Bullet
    if bullet_ready:
        bullets.append(pygame.Rect(main_rect.x + 20, main_rect.y + 40,50,10))
        bullet_ready = False

    # Move Bullet
    for bullet in bullets:
        bullet.x += 5
        pygame.draw.rect(screen,(255,0,0), bullet)

    # Destroy Bullet
    for index , bullet in enumerate(bullets):
        if bullets.x >= 1000:
            del bullets[index]

    # Return Bullet List
    return bullets
